 * Provides comprehensive 2D geometry primitives and algorithms:
 * - Point operations (distance, rotation, reflection, polar/Cartesian)
 * - Line and segment operations (intersection, distance, parallel/perpendicular)
 * - Polygon operations (area, centroid, point-in-polygon, convex hull, triangulation)
